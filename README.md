Pack containing normal M15 frames for MSE. Recommended for slim builds.

# Installation

1. Download and extract [this zip file](https://github.com/MagicSetEditorPacks/Basic-M15-Magic-Pack/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the zip file. It will contain 5 items:
    * a folder `data`, which is where the templates are installed.
    * a folder `Magic - Fonts`, which contains necessary font files.
    * `magicseteditor.exe` and `mse.exe`, the regular version of the app.
    * `magicseteditor - 201`, the previous stable version of the app.
    * `magicseteditor.com`, a command-line version of MSE for advanced users.
4. Inside the extracted folder, open the subfolder `Magic - Fonts`. It contains several `.ttf` and/or `.otf` files. Select them all, right-click on one of them, then click Install.
5. Move or copy all other subfolders into your MSE folder.
