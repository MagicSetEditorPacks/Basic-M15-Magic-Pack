	# Each booster has a 1/8 chance of containing a mythic rare.
	# This means that looking at single mythics : rares, the proportion is
	#  1*53 : 7*15 = 53 : 105
	# this is almost exactly 1 : 2,
	# So, a a single mythic is 2 times as rare as a single normal rare.
	# 
	# We use this proportional system instead of a fixed 1:7 system,
	#  because it copes better with cases where there are few mythics.
	# For example, if a set has 1 mythic and 20 rares, you would actually
	# be MORE likely to find the mythic card with the 1:7 system!
